# Abschlussprojekt_marcri
This is a project from Cristian Martin for the end of my first year as an informatic. I created a Web-site that shows realtime data about natural disasters and has an included AI that analyzes those disasters. 
## How to use
Install node.js (you can download from https://nodejs.org)
```bash
npm init -y
npm install express
npm install
npm install body-parser
npm install @google-cloud/language
npm install @google-cloud/aiplatform
npm install @google/generative-ai
node Backend/server.js
```
Now navigate in your browser to http://localhost:3000

Enjoy ;)
